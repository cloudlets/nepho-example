summary: A simplified single host configuration with Puppet
description: >
  This simple example creates a single public Amazon Linux instance on EC2 using
  CloudFormation, bootstraps Puppet, and performs a few minor configuration
  actions.  It relies only minimally on Jinja2 templating (for parameter
  injection) so that all of the CloudFormation configuration is clear and easily
  modifiable.
